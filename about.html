      <p class="about-txt">
        Trent Pope is an aspiring artist from Utah Valley, Utah. Most of his
        projects are done by working backwards from an original, unaltered
        state, usually involving deconstruction or destruction in one way or
        another. He is not schooled in any specific art form and has no
        emphasis.

      <div class="about-quote">
        I always said punk was an attitude. It was never about having a mohican
        haircut or wearing a ripped t-shirt. It was all about destruction, and
        the creative potential within that.
