This is my project. It is a creative portfolio for some of the projects that I am working on. I wanted to have elements of the Early-2000s internet with my nav bar, but also some modern elements like a sticky logo and minimalist layout.
Here are some of the things that I learned while developing this site:

- pointer-events lets you control what happens when the cursor is above the object.
- overflow:hidden will break position:sticky
- you can't just type out colors when you want the opacity settings to be different than solid
- to stop a sticky flow, you have to put the content where you want it to stop flowing outside of the parent that the sticky item is in.

Problems:

- display:table was so confusing to understand at first, but I finally got it and I started to really like it towards the end. Table ended up being the way that I structured most of my pages.
- I kept on accidentally calling too many divs with one CSS selector and that was driving me crazy in the beginning, but I learned about how to be specific with which things I was selecting.
