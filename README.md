This is my project. It is a creative portfolio for some of the projects that I am working on. I wanted it to capture the early 2000s, birth-of-the-internet type vibe without looking like a jumbled mess of stuff.
Here are some of the things that I learned while developing this site:

- pointer-events lets you control what happens when the cursor is above the object.
- overflow:hidden will break position:sticky
- you can't just type out colors when you want the opacity settings to be different than solid
- to stop a sticky flow, you have to put the content where you want it to stop flowing outside of the parent that the sticky item is in.
